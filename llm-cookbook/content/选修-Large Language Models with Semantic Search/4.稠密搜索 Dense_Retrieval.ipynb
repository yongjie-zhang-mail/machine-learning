The editors of the Arden Shakespeare question the idea of \"source hunting\", pointing out that it presupposes that authors always require ideas from other works for their own, and suggests that no author can have an original idea or be an originator. When Shakespeare wrote there were many stories about sons avenging the murder of their fathers, and many about clever avenging sons pretending to be foolish in order to outsmart their foes. This would include the story of the ancient Roman, Lucius Junius Brutus, which Shakespeare apparently knew, as well as the story of Amleth, which was preserved in Latin by 13th-century chronicler Saxo Grammaticus in his \"Gesta Danorum\", and printed in Paris in 1514. The Amleth story was subsequently adapted and then published in French in 1570 by the 16th-century scholar François de Belleforest. It has a number of plot elements and major characters in common with Shakespeare's \"Hamlet\", and lacks others that are found in Shakespeare. Belleforest's story was first published in English in 1608, after \"Hamlet\" had been written, though it's possible that Shakespeare had encountered it in the French-language version.\n","\n","title:Hamlet\n","\n","url:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13554\n","\n","views:3000\n","\n","\n","item 1\n","_additional:{'distance': -154.56943}\n","\n","lang:en\n","\n","text:English poet John Milton was an early admirer of Shakespeare and took evident inspiration from his work.

Warren argues, \"Paradise Lost\"s Satan \"undergoes a transformation in the poem from a Hamlet-like avenger into a Claudius-like usurper,\" a plot device that supports Milton's larger Republican internationalist project. The poem also reworks theatrical language from \"Hamlet\", especially around the idea of \"putting on\" certain dispositions, as when Hamlet puts on \"an antic disposition,\" similarly to the Son in \"Paradise Lost\" who \"can put on / [God's] terrors.\"\n","\n","title:Hamlet\n","\n","url:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13554\n","\n","views:3000\n","\n","\n","item 2\n","_additional:{'distance': -154.2872}\n","\n","lang:en\n","\n","text:The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark, often shortened to Hamlet (), is a tragedy written by William Shakespeare sometime between 1599 and 1601.

Since at least the 1930s, supporters of the Crown have held the opinion that the Canadian monarch is also one of the rare unified elements of Canadian society, focusing both \"the historic consciousness of the nation\" and various forms of patriotism and national love \"[on] the point around which coheres the nation's sense of a continuing personality\". Former Governor General Vincent Massey articulated in 1967 that the monarchy \"is part of ourselves. It is linked in a very special way with our national life. It stands for qualities and institutions which mean Canada to every one of us and which for all our differences and all our variety have kept Canada Canadian.\" But, according to Arthur Bousfield and Gary Toffoli, Canadians were, through the late 1960s to the 2000s, encouraged by the federal government to \"neglect, ignore, forget, reject, debase, suppress, even hate, and certainly treat as foreign what their parents and grandparents, whether spiritual or blood, regarded as the basis of Canadian nationhood, autonomy, and history\", including the monarchy. Former Governor General Roland Michener said in 1970 that anti-monarchists claimed the Canadian Crown is foreign and incompatible with Canada's multicultural society, which the government promoted as a Canadian identifier, and Lawrence Martin called in 2007 for Canada to become a republic in order to \"re-brand the nation\". However, Michener also stated, \"[the monarchy] is our own by inheritance and choice, and contributes much to our distinctive Canadian identity and our chances of independent survival amongst the republics of North and South America.\" Journalist Christina Blizzard emphasized in 2009 that the monarchy \"made [Canada] a haven of peace and justice for immigrants from around the world\", while Michael Valpy contended in 2009 that the Crown's nature permitted non-conformity amongst its subjects, thereby opening the door to multiculturalism and pluralism.\n","\n","title:Monarchy of Canada\n","\n","url:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=56504\n","\n","\n","item 1\n","text:North America outside the zone of Spanish settlement was a contested area in the 17th century. Spain had founded small settlements in Florida and Georgia but nowhere near the size of those in New Spain or the Caribbean islands. France, The Netherlands, and Great Britain held several colonies in North America and the West Indies from the 17th century, 100 years after the Spanish and Portuguese established permanent colonies. The British colonies in North America were founded between 1607 (Virginia) and 1733 (Georgia). The Dutch explored the east coast of North America and began founding settlements in what they called New Netherland (now New York State.). France colonized what is now Eastern Canada, founding Quebec City in 1608. France's loss in the Seven Years' War resulted in the transfer of New France to Great Britain. The Thirteen Colonies, in lower British North America, rebelled against British rule in 1775, largely due to the taxation that Great Britain was imposing on the colonies. The British colonies in Canada remained loyal to the crown, and a provisional government formed by the Thirteen Colonies proclaimed their independence on July 4, 1776 and subsequently became the original 13 United States of America. With the 1783 Treaty of Paris ending the American Revolutionary War, Britain recognised the former Thirteen Colonies' independence.\n","\n","title:Early modern period\n","\n","url:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1291656\n","\n","\n","item 2\n","text:By the Second World War, the Red Ensign was viewed as Canada's \"de facto\" national flag. A joint committee of the Senate and House of Commons was appointed on November 8, 1945, to recommend a national flag to officially adopt. It received 2,409 designs from the public and was addressed by the director of the Historical Section of the Canadian Army, Fortescue Duguid, who pointed out that red and white were Canada's official colours and there was already an emblem representing the country: three joined maple leaves seen on the escutcheon of the Canadian coat of arms. By May 9 the following year, the committee reported back with a recommendation \"that the national flag of Canada should be the Canadian red ensign with a maple leaf in autumn golden colours in a bordered background of white\". The Legislative Assembly of Quebec had urged the committee to not include any of what it deemed as \"foreign symbols\", including the Union Flag, and Mackenzie King, then still prime minister, declined to act on the report; fearing it may lead to political instability. As a result, the Union Flag was kept as a national flag, and the order to fly the Canadian Red Ensign at government buildings was maintained.\n","\n","title:Flag of Canada\n","\n","url:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=97066\n","\n","\n"]}],"source":["from utils import keyword_search\n","\n","query = \"What is the capital of Canada?\"\n","keyword_search_results = keyword_search(query, client)\n","print_result(keyword_search_results)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"dda4f775-d95a-4408-872b-a0d9cf0c7a68","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"dda4f775-d95a-4408-872b-a0d9cf0c7a68","jupyter":{"outputs_hidden":true},"outputId":"a218ae9a-eae2-4986-8e1c-81cfc58878ba"},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["item 0\n","_additional:None\n","\n","lang:zh\n","\n","text:嘉靖三十四年农历腊月十二（1556年1月23日），山西、陕西和河南同时发生地震。这次地震分布在陕西、山西、河南、甘肃等地，地震波及大半个中国，有感范围远达福建、两广等地。百姓民众因压砸、焚溺与饥疫而死者无法估计。死亡人口之多幾乎達到當時中國人口的百分之一，也是古今中外地震史上僅有的案例。这次大地震使陕西、山西、河南等省97州受灾，101个县受害，灾区面积大约28万平方公里。地震有感范围为5省227个县。“余震月动三五次者半年，未止息者三载，五年渐轻方止”。\n","\n","title:嘉靖大地震\n","\n","url:https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=65483\n","\n","views:900\n","\n","\n","item 1\n","_additional:None\n","\n","lang:zh\n","\n","text:嘉靖三十四年农历腊月十二（1556年1月23日），山西、陕西和河南同时发生地震。这次地震分布在陕西、山西、河南、甘肃等地，地震波及大半个中国大陸，有感范围远达福建、两广等地。百姓民众因压砸、焚溺、与饥疫而死者无法估计，其奏报有名者便达83万有多，不知名者不可胜数。死亡人口之多幾達當時人口的百分之一，也是古今中外地震史上僅有的案例。这次大地震致使陕西、山西、河南等省97州受灾，101个县受害，灾区面积大约28万平方公里。地震有感范围为5省227个县。“余震月动三五次者半年，未止息者三载，五年渐轻方止”。由于明代后期吏治腐败，国库空虚。地震发生后明朝从国库调拨大量资金用于救灾，导致明朝国库连续两年亏空，加上地震引发的自然灾害和瘟疫导致明朝政府税收减少，对明朝的国力和财政状况亦造成不同程度的影响。\n","\n","title:明世宗\n","\n","url:https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10973\n","\n","views:1000\n","\n","\n","item 2\n","_additional:None\n","\n","lang:zh\n","\n","text:嘉靖三十四年农历腊月十二（1556年1月23日），山西、陕西和河南同时发生地震。这次地震分布在陕西、山西、河南、甘肃等地，地震波及大半个中国，有感范围远达福建、两广等地。百姓民众因压砸、焚溺、与饥疫而死者无法估计，其奏报有名者便达83万有多，不知名者不可胜数。死亡人口之多幾達當時中國人口的百分之一，也是古今中外地震史上僅有的案例。这次大地震致使陕西、山西、河南等省97州受灾，101个县受害，灾区面积大约28万平方公里。地震有感范围为5省227个县。“余震月动三五次者半年，未止息者三载，五年渐轻方止”。由于明代后期吏治腐败，国库空虚。地震发生后明朝从国库调拨大量资金用于救灾，导致明朝国库连续两年亏空，加上地震引发的自然灾害和瘟疫导致明朝政府税收减少，对明朝的国力和财政状况亦造成不同程度的影响。\n","\n","title:明朝\n","\n","url:https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=428010\n","\n","views:2000\n","\n","\n"]}],"source":["from utils import keyword_search\n","\n","query = \"山西\"\n","keyword_search_results = keyword_search(query, client,results_lang='zh')\n","print_result(keyword_search_results)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"529e8a97","metadata":{"id":"529e8a97"},"source":["### 2.3 更复杂的查询功能\n","\n","我们问一些更难回答的问题，看看两种检索算法的差异。"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"a_WeV_5lSxUc","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"a_WeV_5lSxUc","outputId":"23f54873-2ab5-48aa-9cf3-96f3db81930f"},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["item 0\n","_additional:None\n","\n","lang:en\n","\n","text:The population of Japan peaked at 128,083,960 in 2008.

By 2010 liquefied natural gas production had reached 77 million tons, making Qatar the richest country in the world. With fewer than two million inhabitants, the average income in the country shot to a staggering $86,440 per year per person. Qatar expert Olivier Da Lage said: \"When he came to power in 1995, Sheikh Hamad had a goal to place Qatar on the world map by exploiting the gas resources which his father did not develop for fear it would change the emirate's society. Eighteen years on, he has finished the job – Qatar has acquired the financial clout to command respect from neighboring countries and Western governments alike\".In 2005, under the direction of Hamad and the former prime minister of Qatar Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber Al Thani, the Qatar Investment Authority was established, a sovereign wealth fund to manage the country's oil and natural gas surpluses. The Qatar Investment Authority and its subsidiaries have acquired many businesses abroad, including London's iconic department store Harrods from entrepreneur Mohammed Al-Fayed, Paris-based department store Printemps, French football club Paris Saint-Germain F.C., a former 10% stake in Porsche, a 75% stake in film studio Miramax Films which they acquired from Disney, a 2% stake in media conglomerate and Universal Music Group parent company Vivendi, a $100 million USD investment in Chernin Group – whose founder Peter Chernin was COO of News Corp and President of Fox, a 1% stake in luxury goods manufacturer Louis Vuitton Moët Hennessy, a 6% stake in Credit Suisse, a 12.6% stake in Barclays and several other major companies. They also backed Glencore's $31 billion takeover bid for Xstrata. Qatar is the largest property owner in London with their holdings including the United Kingdom's tallest building The Shard, the London Olympic Village and the InterContinental London Park Lane hotel. They also own several hotels in Cannes including the Majestic Hotel, Grand Hyatt Cannes Hôtel Martinez and the Carlton Hotel, Cannes. QIA was considered to have one of the leading bids in the sales of both Anschutz Entertainment Group and Hulu.
